  <p class="editable">Ethnic Hilltribe Eco Trails was founded by Khun Mit and his wife Kischa. They started these trails with the dream to give people a chance to experience real authentic hiking trails, visit hilltribe villages and experience the culture of northern Thailand hilltribes in the same way they enjoy so much.</p>

  <h2 class="editable">Our Impact</h2>
  <h4 class="editable">Supporting family run business or sustainable and responsible companies.</h4>
  <p class="editable">With our treks and hilltribe experiences, we hope to empower ethnic hilltribe and local families like us and their communities, by taking our guests out to enjoy authentic jungle experiences, which promote sustainable, ethical tourism and give back to these indigenous families by hiring only local guides and porters who will then train through us to finally get their tour guide licenses. Also staying in a farm stay (Doi Inthanon Trail) that we have been working on with the local Karen Hilltribe community through skills development, building and farmstay management. This will help create more jobs, help the younger generation and older, have more skills and another means of income when they are unable to farm.
