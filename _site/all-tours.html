          <h3>3 Hours Trekking and 10K White-Water Rafting</h3>
          <p>
            3-hour trekking adventure to a waterfall is a nice way to see the jungle and cool off in the water. The trek itself is about 1.6 km through the jungle to a 10 m waterfall. Here you will take a break so you can go for a swim, so it’s good to be changed into your swimming clothes at the camp before you start the hike. 10 km White water rafting has it all and is broken into 3 sections. 1st is a great warm-up where you learn skills practicing with the guides and getting used to the boat. This section has one class III and is probably the most beautiful section of the river with the encroaching jungle offering lots of shade. The middle section is an action-packed with rapids and is probably the best Whitewater in Thailand. Most of this section is class III and IV rapids. The 3rd section lets up in the beginning giving you some time to relax before entering a great class III and into short continuous section of rapids. The company you will be rafting with has have top-of-the-line equipment expert trained guides to make sure you have a safe adventure. They have towels for you when you finish and shower facilities that you can use before heading home. Make sure to bring a 2nd set of dry clothes so you can ride home dry.
