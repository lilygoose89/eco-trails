    Hi, we're Mit and Kischa, the founders of Ethnic Hilltribe Eco Trails. We met and fell in love on a jungle trek in Chiang Mai, and we started this company with a dream. We love our home, and want to give people a chance to experience real, authentic hiking trails, visit hilltribe villages, and experience the culture of northern Thailand hilltribes in the same intimate and personal way that we do.<br /><br />Beyond leading off-the-beaten path journeys, we're also passionate about sustainable tourism. We've seen first-hand how education and training can lift, not just families, but entire villages out of poverty, and we're committed to providing tourism support and opportunies to our guides and partners. Let us introduce you to our hilltribe family and friends and show you the beauty of northern Thailand's hills and rainforests.

  <h2 class="editable">Our Impact</h2>
  <h4 class="editable">Supporting family run business and sustainable, responsible companies.</h4>
  <p class="editable">
    With our treks and hilltribe experiences, we aim to empower ethnic hilltribe and local families like us and their communities by taking our guests out to enjoy authentic jungle experiences which promote sustainable, ethical tourism. We're comitted to giving back to these indigenous families by hiring only local drivers, guides and porters. We create jobs and income for our local Karen songtaew drivers and our local guides and porters will then train through us to finally get their tour guide licenses.<br /><br />We have also helped develop a family farmstay which we overnight at on the 2 Day Doi Inthanon Trail. We support this farmstay and the local Karen Hilltribe community through tourism and hospitality training. This farmstay will help create more jobs and provide an alternative source of income for both the younger and older generations when they are unable to farm.
