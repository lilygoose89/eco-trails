    Eco Tours and Treks in Northern Thailand

  <p class="editable">
    Welcome to your next adventure! Ethnic Hilltribe Eco Trails is a small, family-run tour operator offering eco tours and treks around Chiang Mai, Thailand. We take travelers on authentic and breath-taking journeys through the unspoiled jungles and hills of Pha Daeng in Chiang Dao, Doi Inthanon in Chiang Mai and more.<br /><br />We don't do your typical hikes, instead, we take you on a Karen hilltribe style jungle walk, creating your own path, immersing yourself in the forest, and getting to know the local culture. If you're looking to get away from the tourist experience and explore nature like a true native, then you've come to the right place.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="&lt;a  data-cke-saved-href='https://www.momondo.de/city-guides/discover-Chiang-Mai.6042.guide.ksp' href='https://www.momondo.de/city-guides/discover-Chiang-Mai.6042.guide.ksp' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img width='200' height='200'  data-cke-saved-src='https://www.momondo.de/discover/wp-content/uploads/sites/264/2021/06/design_image_momondo_travel-guides_badge_circle_color-alt_find-us-on-mm-tg.png' src='https://www.momondo.de/discover/wp-content/uploads/sites/264/2021/06/design_image_momondo_travel-guides_badge_circle_color-alt_find-us-on-mm-tg.png' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;	">...</a><br />&nbsp;

    Featured Tours and Treks
  </h2>
  <p class="editable text-center">
    We're best known for our completely off-the-beaten-track hiking trails in some of northern Thailand's most beautiful National Parks. Journey with us to Doi Inthanon National Park and climb the highest mountain in Thailand or to Pha Daeng National Park in Chiang Dao, rich in tropical flora and fauna.<br /><br />The places we go are incredibly scenic and non-touristic. Trek through the heart of the rainforest, visit hidden waterfalls, discover incredible view points or catch a glimpse of wild gibbons. Visit hilltribe villages where our guides are from, and discover the depths of their ethnic wisdom. Learn about their way of life and the secrets of traditional herbal medicines used for centuries.<br /><br />Our two day trails will either take you to sleep in a hilltribe village in the mountains of Chiang Dao or to the Churkee Farmstay over looking the mountains or homestay amid the rice fields of a Karen hilltribe village in Doi Inthanon National Park.
